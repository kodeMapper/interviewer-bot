      "question": "Sarang, your PulseAI - Health Risk Prediction System caught my eye, especially achieving 86.7% accuracy and 94.5% high-risk recall using Gradient Boosting for maternal health. Could you walk me through the most significant challenge you faced in achieving those specific metrics, perhaps in data preprocessing or model training, and how you overcame it?",
      "type": "deep_dive",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "expected_answer": "Candidate should discuss data quality, imbalance issues, feature engineering challenges, or fine-tuning Gradient Boosting parameters. Mentioning cross-validation strategies or handling false positives/negatives would be a plus.",

      "question": "That's a very clear explanation. You deployed the PulseAI frontend on Vercel and the backend on Render for real-time cloud-based predictions. Why did you choose Vercel for the frontend and Render for the backend, and what were the key considerations or trade-offs between them, or perhaps against a unified deployment strategy?",
      "type": "tradeoff",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "expected_answer": "Candidate should discuss Vercel's strengths for static/serverless frontends (CDN, ease of deployment for Next.js/React) and Render's capabilities for persistent backend services (databases, long-running processes). Trade-offs might include cost, configuration complexity, or latency between services.",

      "question": "Moving to another impressive project, the Stamped Management System, you achieved 90% accuracy, 28-50 FPS inference, and sub-100ms alert latency for real-time surveillance. The sub-100ms alert latency is particularly challenging for real-time video processing.

      "difficulty": "hard",
