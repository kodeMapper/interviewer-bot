1. when interview starts - 
it goes like: `Hello! I am your AI Interviewer. Based on your selection, I will be asking you questions on ${skillList}. Let me start with a few warmup questions while I analyze your resume in the background. Get ready!`

the above sentence does not gets complete. immidiatly the model starts asking questions. sometimes, it gets partially completed.

2. sometimes, there is a problem with processing the question sets from the gemini. logs are as follows:
📝 ✅ Gemini response received (25763 chars)

✅ Generated 20 resume-based questions using gemini-2.5-flash (PDF mode)
[Resume BG] Generated 20 questions in 55.9s

4. sometimes bot high volume voice --> interrupt --> normal voice 

5. evaluation should be better. check the deep learning model, that is it evaluating the answers correctly or not. at last also state that (by training the deep learning model if not), how much confident/scared/nervous/etc the candidate was.

6. final score and avg scores are diffrent, why?
