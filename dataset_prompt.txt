I am building a Deep Learning-based Intent Classifier for an AI Technical Interviewer (University Project).
I need a training dataset of **user responses** labeled by their technical topic(s).
Please generate a JSON list of objects with two fields:
- `text`: Strategies of what a student might say in an interview.
- `label`: A LIST of technical topics mentioned (Multi-label).

**Topics to Generate (25 examples per topic + Mixed examples):**
1. `Java` (Core Java, OOP, Collections, JVM)
2. `Python` (Syntax, Libraries like Pandas/NumPy, Scripting)
3. `JavaScript` (ES6, Async/Await, DOM, Closures)
4. `React` (Hooks, Components, Virtual DOM, State Management)
5. `SQL` (Select, Joins, Normalization, ACID properties)
6. `Machine_Learning` (Regression, Classification, Clustering, Scikit-learn)
7. `Deep_Learning` (Neural Networks, Backpropagation, CNNs, Activation Functions)

**CRITICAL: Use Data Augmentation Techniques (Module 6) to vary the `text`:**
To prevent the model from memorizing simple patterns, apply these constraints randomly:

1.  **Style Transfer (Roleplay):**
    *   30% specific "Nervous Beginners" (e.g., "Umm.. I think Java uses classes? not sure.")
    *   30% specific "Arrogant/Brief Experts" (e.g., "JVM executes bytecode. Simple.")
    *   40% specific "Standard Candidates" (e.g., "I use Python for data analysis.")

2.  **Noise Injection:**
    *   Randomly remove punctuation.
    *   Use lowercase 'i' instead of 'I'.
    *   Add filler words: "uh", "like", "basically", "actually".

3.  **Synonym Replacement:**
    *   Do NOT always use the word "use" or "know".
    *   Swap with: "utilize", "coded in", "built a project with", "familiar with", "worked on".

4.  **Imbalanced Lengths:**
    *   Make some answers just 1-2 words (e.g., "React mostly.")
    *   Make some answers long and descriptive (2 sentences).

5.  **MIXED CONCEPTS (Crucial):**
    *   Include sentences where candidates compare or mention two topics.
    *   Example: "I know java but I prefer python for scripting." -> Label: ["Java", "Python"]
    *   Example: "Diff between java and javascript is type safety." -> Label: ["Java", "JavaScript"]
    *   Example: "I use React with a SQL backend." -> Label: ["React", "SQL"]

**Output Format:**
Provide ONLY the raw JSON array. No markdown explanation.
```json
[
  {"text": "basically java is object oriented stuff", "label": ["Java"]},
  {"text": "I utilize useEffect for side effects in functional components", "label": ["React"]},
  {"text": "I used to code in Java but now I mostly do Python scripting", "label": ["Java", "Python"]},
  {"text": "select star from tables where id = 1", "label": ["SQL"]},
  {"text": "whats the diff between sql and nosql", "label": ["SQL"]}
]
```
Generate roughly 25 distinct examples for EACH single topic, PLUS 50 examples of Mixed/Comparison combinations.
